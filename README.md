# Limited Messages Board
A webapp that publicly displays 10 user messages.
Kinda scrappy but its cool.

Built with Node.js, & express. The 'database' to store messages is
just a javascript array (messages reset on server restart).

This is probably somehow exploitable but it was a fun little project
to start getting my hands dirty with Node.js.
